# **AI Vision, Growth, Progression Proposal: Operation Excellence Team**

To: Elvin Gan, Head of Department  
From: Zhi Jun, BI Team Lead, Operation Excellence  
Date: July 11, 2025  
Subject: A Strategic Proposal for the Evolution of the Operation Excellence Team

#### **1\. Introduction: A Vision for a "Process Intelligence" Team**

**Rationale:** The rationale for this transformation is twofold: to mitigate the significant operational risk posed by the company's undocumented automation landscape and to proactively build the foundational capabilities required for a scalable, AI-managed enterprise.

This document presents a strategic proposal for the evolution of the Operation Excellence team. The core objective is to align the team's function with the company's "AI-first" vision by transforming it into a central **"Process Intelligence Team."** Currently, the operational framework includes over 300 automated workflows that lack comprehensive documentation. This proposal outlines a plan to address this by developing a "Team of AI Agents" to systematically analyze and manage these workflows. The initial phase is to construct a "Universal Assessor Agent" to map the existing automation landscape, providing the foundational intelligence for an effective migration to an AI-managed ecosystem.

#### **2\. Proposed Role & Skill Progression**

**Rationale:** The following role progression is designed to leverage each team member's unique strengths while systematically building the necessary competencies for an AI-first future. This ensures personal growth is directly aligned with strategic business objectives.

This transformation necessitates a structured evolution of the team's roles and capabilities. The focus will shift from manual execution to strategic oversight and AI-driven initiatives.

| Team Member | Proposed Future Role | Core Responsibilities & Skill Development |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Zhi Jun** | **AI Process Architect** | Zhi Jun's role will transition from direct implementation to architecting the governing framework for the "Team of AI Agents." Zhi Junâ€™s comprehensive experience will be utilized to design the system architecture and data governance model. |
| **Ryan Foo** | **AI Business Translator** | Ryan will leverage his expertise in process design and stakeholder management to serve as the primary liaison between business requirements and AI capabilities, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the agents' analyses. |
| **Ivan Wong** | **AI Automation Developer** | Ivan will concentrate on the technical development of the team's AI agents and the refactoring of legacy workflows into optimized Apex code, thereby deepening his expertise in software development and automation. |

#### **3\. Strategic Roadmap: An Accelerated 6-Month Plan**

**Rationale:** This accelerated roadmap is designed to deliver demonstrable value within the first quarter, building momentum and proving the viability of the proposed approach. Each deliverable is a strategic step toward the end-state vision: establishing a foundation, proving the concept, and then expanding capabilities.

This vision is supported by a defined and actionable implementation plan designed for rapid value delivery. The team's primary focus for the next six months will be the parallel development of its foundational AI agents.

* **Flagship Initiative:** Develop the **"Universal Assessor Agent v1.0."**  
* **Key Deliverables:**  
  * **By End of Q3 2025:** Complete a comprehensive, AI-generated analysis of all 300+ Salesforce automations, producing a data-driven roadmap for the Flow-to-Apex migration strategy.  
  * **By End of Q4 2025:** As a proof-of-concept, Ivan will have re-engineered the top three most inefficient workflows into optimized Apex code, demonstrating the tangible benefits of this approach.  
  * **By End of Q1 2026:** Integrate AWS process analysis into the Assessor Agent's capabilities to create a more holistic view of operational workflows.

#### **4\. Parallel Initiatives & Immediate Impact**

**Rationale:** The purpose of outlining these parallel initiatives is to demonstrate the scalability and broad applicability of the Process Intelligence platform. Upon establishing the foundational Assessor Agent, the team can immediately begin addressing other critical business areas, maximizing the return on the initial investment.

Upon the successful completion of the initial Salesforce assessment in Q3, the team will immediately initiate work on subsequent high-impact projects, running them in parallel with the ongoing development of the Assessor Agent.

* **Initiating in Q4 2025 \- Intercom Conversation Intelligence Agent:** An AI-powered tool to perform real-time analysis of customer support transcripts to identify emerging trends, categorize issues, and measure customer sentiment.  
* **Initiating in Q4 2025 \- Automated Commission Reconciliation Bot:** A fully automated system to manage sales commission calculations by integrating data from Salesforce, Chargebee, and Netsuite (managed by Finance), thereby increasing efficiency and accuracy.  
* **Initiating in Q1 2026 \- Proactive System Monitoring Agent:** An AI agent designed to monitor logs from critical business systems (e.g., Aircall, Zapier) to detect and diagnose technical issues before they impact end-users.

#### **5\. Performance Measurement & Team Development**

**Rationale:** A dual focus on objective performance measurement and intrinsic motivation is critical for sustained success. This section outlines a framework to ensure accountability through transparent KPIs while fostering a culture of innovation and growth through targeted development programs.

Progress will be tracked via an automated **Impact Dashboard** to ensure objective and transparent reporting on key performance indicators, such as **"% of Processes Assessed"** and **"Average Process Complexity Score."** To foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation, an **"AI Contributor Program"** will be established. This initiative will include internal skill certifications and dedicated time for creative experimentation, ensuring the team remains motivated and at the forefront of technological advancements.

This proposal outlines a clear path to realizing the company's AI objectives while facilitating significant professional growth for the team. The team is confident in its ability to execute this vision and welcomes the opportunity to discuss it further.
